						<h3> Stat Changes </h3>

						<p> Over the course of this game being out, for almost a year when this website is released, plants and zombies have been changed and updated in order to save space while coding them or to balance the cards: meaning to change the card such that it is not overpowered, but on the other hand, it is still playable by all. As of now, we have noticed many crippling problems with some of the cards sometimes that they do not really have the space and time on the battlefield to show how powerful these cards are. As a result, we are making these tiny edits to make the game a little bit more fair and manageable.  *** FYI (a,h) means a is for attack, and h is for health.

						Beta Carrotina is a special hero (plant on the left) which has appeared with the recent Galactic Gardens Update. She specifically looks like a carrot, and her name is a pun on the word carrot as well. She is a space hero, similar to how Citron, another hero, is portrayed as well. Coincidently, they both have the same classes too: having the Guardian Class and the Smarty Class.

						Huge Giganticus is a special hero (zombie on the right) which has appeared with the recent Galactic Gardens Update. According to his title, Huge Giganticus should be a very big person, but ironically he is pretty small: an imp (small zombie) on a hovering platform. He shares the same classes as Super Brainz, another hero already in the game: The Brainy Class and the Sneaky Class.

This would be stressed in this current update: as many plants and zombies need to be nerfed (make them a little worse) cause problem in the gameplay clips we collected.
