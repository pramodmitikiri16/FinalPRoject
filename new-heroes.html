							<h3> Updated New Plant Hero! Introducing Beta Carrotina! <br> <small> Posted on July 17th </small></h3>

						<p> With this new update, 2 new heroes have been updated. [You can either purchase them using gems (in game currency), or you can earn them by luck of draw.] However, these two heroes are different from the others since they both copy a another hero's abilities. Given 5 abilities for the plant division and the zombie division, it would make sense that there can be 10 heroes that would be all unique to each other. (ex. Solar Flare: Solar and Kabloom; Rose: Solar and Smarty). These two heroes are Beta Carrotina and Huge Giganticus, a plant hero and a zombie hero respectively. In this article, we will be referring to Beta Carrotina, the plant hero. 

						</p>



						<h4> Beta Carrotina  </h4>

						<p> Beta Carrotina is a special hero (plant on the left) which has appeared with the recent Galactic Gardens Update. She specifically looks like a carrot, and her name is a pun on the word carrot as well. She is a space hero, similar to how Citron, another hero, is portrayed as well. Coincidently, they both have the same classes too: having the Guardian Class and the Smarty Class. (For reference about these classes, click <a href = "http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies_Heroes"> here </a> to understand why this is important.) Although this is the case, Beta Carrotina has a whole new set of abilities and tricks that set her apart from the other heroes already in the game.	</p>

						<br>

					<h5> Description: </h5>
						<p> As leader of the Plant-etary Guard, she's ready to root out Zombies wherever they crop up. </p> <br> 

					<h5> Card Decks </h5>
						<p> 1. The Root Cause: This is where players are able to place down roots of their choice, and when you put down a "Starch-Lord" (boosts all your roots), the game becomes easier as you can put 1-cost root cards on the battelfield. This is a common deck, and does not need that many legendaries or super-rare cards.  </p> <br>

						<p> 2. Amphi-bean Assault: This is where you are able to play your amphibious plants (plants that can go in any lanes) excessively with the "Navy Beans" (boosts all amphibious plants) in addition to the "Admiral Navy Bean", which does 2 damage for everytime a bean is played. This is a rare deck, and you may have to work hard to obtain all 40 cards in the deck. </p> <br>

						<p> 3. Starch Wars: This is where you are able to play a control deck, where you are able to take control of the battelfield despite the number of zombies across from you in the battlefield. You can use as many tricks as you want as well as destroying all zombies in one go. This showcases 8 legendaries, and overall, if you want to play this deck, it is a legendary deck, and not many people can pull this deck off due to how much money you need to spend in order to get what you want.  </p> <br> 

					<h5> Superpowers </h5>
						<p> 1. Ensign Uproot (cost 1, is a plant). "When played: Move another Plant or Zombie"; Description: His mighty tractor beam is straight off the farm and out of this world. </p> <br>
						<p> 2. Lieutenant Carrotron (cost 1, is a plant). " (Team-Up) When played: Conjure a root" [Team-Up: this plant can be in another lane with another plant; Conjure: obtain specific card (ex. conjure a root means to obtain a random "root" plant)]; Description: Bera-Carrotina hows she can always count on him to get to the root of the problem. </p> <br>
						<p> 3. Lightspeed Seed (cost 1, is a trick)." Conjure two tricks [obtain two random plant tricks from anywhere in the game]; Description: Make the jump to light seed. </p> <br>
						<p> 4. Genetic Amplification (cost 1, is a special legendary trick). "Conjure a 2-cost plant; it gets (+1) attack and health, the amphibious trait, and Team-Up" [In other words, obtain a random plant that costs 2 sun in the game. Add +1 to the attack and +1 to the health. If not already: give the plant the amphibious trait as well as the Team-Up trait]; Description: The modifications are controversial, sure. But the results are hard to argue with. </p> <br>

						Huge Giganticus is a special hero (zombie on the right) which has appeared with the recent Galactic Gardens Update. According to his title, Huge Giganticus should be a very big person, but ironically he is pretty small: an imp (small zombie) on a hovering platform. He shares the same classes as Super Brainz, another hero already in the game: The Brainy Class and the Sneaky Class.

							Over the course of this game being out, for almost a year when this website is released, plants and zombies have been changed and updated in order to save space while coding them or to balance the cards: meaning to change the card such that it is not overpowered, but on the other hand, it is still playable by all. As of now, we have noticed many crippling problems with some of the cards sometimes that they do not really have the space and time on the battlefield to show how powerful these cards are.

This would be stressed in this current update: as many plants and zombies need to be nerfed (make them a little worse) cause problem in the gameplay clips we collected.
