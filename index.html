					<h3><a href = "#"> 2 New Heroes </a> </h3>
					<p> 
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this new update, 2 new heroes have been updated. [You can either purchase them using gems (in game currency), or you can earn them by luck of draw.] However, these two heroes are different from the others since they both copy a another hero's abilities. Given 5 abilities for the plant division and the zombie division, it would make sense that there can be 10 heroes that would be all unique to each other. (ex. Solar Flare: Solar and Kabloom; Rose: Solar and Smarty). These two heroes ...

					<h3><a href = "#"> Changes for the Old Cards </a> </h3>
					<p> 
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking through some sample gameplay we collected from other people's games, our team realized that some cards were just better than they already were. So, our team collaborated, and it made sense to make these changes on some of our cards. For instance, we changed the attack, health, sun cost, or ability of a couple of plants to keep the game balanced. (Rarity was changed as well: look on the next page.)

So, our team collaborated, and it made sense to make these changes on some of our cards. However, instead of changing the stats of the plant or zombie, our team decided to make some of our cards change rarity so that it is harder to get but is balanced with the added changes.

					<h3><a href = "#"> Season 2 Ranked Multiplayer is Over! </a> </h3>
					<p> 
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey everyone! Now with this new update, we also present to you the end of Season 2 for our Ranked Multiplayer! Yes, we all know it was a short period of time. However, we changed how you played such that it would be easier to attain stars easier to advance to the next stage, so it should have weighted out. In addition we also did give everyone who reached a certain point in our leveling system a free advance to the next set of levels for easier convinience.
