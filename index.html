						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this new update, a new Plant Hero has been updated. [You can either purchase it using gems (in game currency), or you can earn them by luck of draw.] However, this hero is different from the others since it copies another hero's abilities. Given 5 abilities for the plant divison and the zombie division, it would make sense that there can be 10 heroes that would be all unique to each other. (ex. Solar Flare: Solar and Kabloom; Rose: Solar and Smarty) This Plant Hero is ...

					<h3><a href = "stat-changes.html"> Changes for the Old Cards </a> </h3>

					<p> 

						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking through some sample gameplay we collected from other people's games, our team realized that some cards were just better than they already were. So, our team collaborated, and it made sense to make these changes on some of our cards. For instance, we changed the attack, health, sun cost, or ability of a couple of plants to keep the game balanced. (Rarity was changed as well: look on the next page.)

So, our team collaborated, and it made sense to make these changes on some of our cards. However, instead of changing the stats of the plant or zombie, our team decided to make some of our cards change rarity so that it is harder to get but is balanced with the added changes.
