						<p> With this new update, a new hero has been updated. [You can either purchase them using gems (in game currency), or you can earn them by luck of draw.] However, these two heroes are different from the others since they both copy a another hero's abilities. Given 5 abilities for the plant division and the zombie division, it would make sense that there can be 10 heroes that would be all unique to each other. (ex. Solar Flare: Solar and Kabloom; Rose: Solar and Smarty). These two heroes are Beta Carrotina and Huge Giganticus, a plant hero and a zombie hero respectively. In this article, we will be focusing on Huge Giganticus, the new zombie hero. 

						</p>



						<h4> Huge Giganticus </h4>

						<p> Huge Giganticus is a special hero (zombie on the right) which has appeared with the recent Galactic Gardens Update. According to his title, Huge Giganticus should be a very big person, but ironically he is pretty small: an imp (small zombie) on a hovering platform. He shares the same classes as Super Brainz, another hero already in the game: The Brainy Class and the Sneaky Class. (For reference about these classes, click <a href = "http://plantsvszombies.wikia.com/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies_Heroes"> here </a> to understand why this is important.) Despite this drawback, Huge Giganticus plays a heavy role in enviroments, an installed mechanic in the current Galactic Garden update which this specific hero is based from. As a result, he has a whole new set of abilities and tricks that set him apart from the other heroes already in the game. </p>

						<br>

					<h5> Description: </h5>
						<p> Go on, tell him he is actually quite small. See what happens. You're not going to like it. </p> <br> 

					<h5> Card Decks </h5>
						<p> 1. Planetary Terror-Forming: This deck is filled with enviroments; perfect for Huge Giganticus! As you play zombies, they will be beneficially be boosted by turning into better zombies or having the power to shoot directly through the plant as well [Enviroments such as the Transformation Station and the Laser Base Alpha]. However, as you as you are able to place a Neutron Imp on your battelfield; for every time you play an enviroment, Neutron Imp can do a bonus attack and can cause devastating damage if not taken care of properly. This is a common deck, and most players are abelt o pull this off easily.  </p> <br>

						<p> 2. Mission Imp-possible: Based from the deck name, you can assume that this are going to be a ton of imps (small zombies) in your deck. These imps do not cost that much and you can use them to swarm the field so that your Plant Hero cannot do anything at all. Once you are in control of the board, then you can finish off the game with a Space Cowboy to end the game. This is a normal deck since it takes some time in being able to obtain some of the cards, especially the Space Cowboy. </p> <br>

						<p> 3. Doctor What?: This deck relies on a special zombie: Doctor Who, who is able to help you obtain a random card every time he does damages to a plant or the plant hero. In addition, it is based on freezing, so with that, there are tons of cards that can freeze the opponent's plants. But wait... besides stalling the game, freezing can boost another zombie: the Cryo Yeti, which gets +2 to both its attack and health for each time something is frozen. 4 copies of this card are played, but due to the fact that the Cryo Yeti is a legendary card, and overall, there is about 12 cards which are legendary; it may be a hard deck to pull off since it can take a long time to collect those cards. Regardless, this is a very fast and random deck that is fun to play in the end.  </p> <br> 

					<h5> Superpowers </h5>
						<p> 1. Iron Boarder (cost 1, is a zombie). "(Bullseye) While in an Enviroment: This gets (+1) to its health and attack; Description: Working for a Huge-Gigantacus isn't the worst job he's ever had. It comes with a 401Z plan, which is more than what most Zombie employers offer. " </p> <br>

						<p> 2. Teleportation Station (cost 1, is an enviroment). "Start of turn: If there is a Zombie here, gain a 'Teleport' (Teleport: allow zombies to be played after the plants rather then playing before the plants)"Teleportation is relativey new technology. Has a few kinks that need ironing out. So yeah, sometimes things get a little ... mixed up. </p> <br>

						<p> 3. Ice Moon (cost 1, is an enviroment). "Zombies here get Strikethrough. When played: Freeze all plants here. (In other words, all zombies can attack the opposing heroes when played in this enviroment, and when the enviroment is first played: all plants that are in the same enviroment cannot attack for that one turn)" ; Description: Be sure to pack a warm sweater.  </p> <br>

						<p> 4. Terror-Former 10,000 (cost 1, is a legendary trick). "Conjure an Enviroment. All cards in your hands cost 1 less. (To restate, when this is played: obtain a random enviroment you can play later, and then all cards you have in your hands currently are reduced by one brain. This means that you can play these games one turn before when they could actually played. (ex. a 4 cost zombie can now be played for the cost of 3 brains)"; Description: This is Huge-Gigantacus's greatest invention ever. It's also his only invention. But it's best not to point that out to him. </p> <br>

						Beta Carrotina is a special hero (plant on the left) which has appeared with the recent Galactic Gardens Update. She specifically looks like a carrot, and her name is a pun on the word carrot as well. She is a space hero, similar to how Citron, another hero, is portrayed as well. Coincidently, they both have the same classes too: having the Guardian Class and the Smarty Class.

							Over the course of this game being out, for almost a year when this website is released, plants and zombies have been changed and updated in order to save space while coding them or to balance the cards: meaning to change the card such that it is not overpowered, but on the other hand, it is still playable by all. As of now, we have noticed many crippling problems with some of the cards sometimes that they do not really have the space and time on the battlefield to show how powerful these cards are.

This would be stressed in this current update: as many plants and zombies need to be nerfed (make them a little worse) cause problem in the gameplay clips we collected.
